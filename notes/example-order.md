## Part 1 (regression)

### Introduction



### Linear regression
- cars (speed vs distance)
  - very simple data, intuitive to understand
- seatbelts save lives
  - Time series data doesn't really fit in the workshop
- bill length of penguins
  - includes categorical predictor (penguin species)
- penguin mass vs flipper length
  - only continuous variables, diagnostics are good.

### Categorical factors
- penguin body mass by species
  - model diagnostics aren't great
  - replace by chickwts
- chickwts
  - if there is a default diet, set it as the default factor level
  

### GLMs
- sex of penguins
  - not really a response
- Titanic data
  - diagnostics aren't great
- insect count by spray

- esophogeal cancel (esoph)
  - ordered factors: results come back in linear, quadratic etc. terms

# Part two (mixed-effects)
- sleep study (random interept)
- sleep study (random slopes)
- orange trees (circumference ~ age)


## Pt 2 (mixed-effects models)

### Fixed vs random effects
