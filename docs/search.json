    "text": "Overview\n\n\nDescription\nRegression modeling — using input variables to predict or model the value of a response — is widely used in pretty much every field of research. Yet many graduate programs don’t include formal training in statistical modeling, and the DataLab’s office hours indicate widespread anxiety about using regression models in practice. This workshop is intended to help address that anxiety by teaching the fundamentals of using regression modeling in practice. The emphasis is on practice and intuition, with only a small amount of math. This workshop is open to all UC Davis graduate students and postdoctoral scholars. Attendance at both sessions is required. Instruction is in-person and seats are limited. A Zoom link (e.g., broadcast) will be available for those unable to attend who would like to watch live.\n\n\nLearning objectives\nAfter this workshop, learners will be able to: - Understand the differences between linear and generalized linear regression models - Understand the difference between fixed effects and random effects in regression models - Understand how continuous and categorical variables are handled differently in regression modeling software - Implement the above-mentioned model types - Read and interpret regression summary tables - Do diagnostic checks on your regression models"

    "section": "The linear model",
    "text": "The linear model\nLet’s say what we mean by a “linear model”. This is an equation that describes some output variable as a linear function of some input variable(s).\nNote that the linear model is a relationship, while linear regression is a method of estimating that relationship. But since it is by far the most common way of estimating that relationship, the terms are often used interchangeably.\nThe data for a linear model are typically in a spreadsheet format, where each row of data is called an “observation” and each column is called a “feature”. The column that is the outcome of the model is called the “response”. Each observation should include a value for every feature (there are some ways of handling missing data but that’s beyond our scope for this workshop).\n\nPreparation\nYour computer will do whatever you tell it to do, even if it’s not a good idea. With this great power comes the responsibility to think, and to check your assumptions.\nThe first one to mention is the assumption that there is a relationship between the features and the response, of the type that the model describes. Your first, best way to test that assumption is to plot the data. Summaries like the means, variances, and correlations can only tell you so much. The following example points out why.\nThe Datasaurus dozen are a collection of thirteen data sets consisting of two features (x and y) that have the same means, variances, and correlations.\n\n\n# A tibble: 13 × 6\n   dataset    correlation  x_mn x_var  y_mn y_var\n   &lt;chr&gt;            &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 away            -0.064  54.3  281.  47.8  726.\n 2 bullseye        -0.069  54.3  281.  47.8  726.\n 3 circle          -0.068  54.3  281.  47.8  725.\n 4 dino            -0.064  54.3  281.  47.8  726.\n 5 dots            -0.06   54.3  281.  47.8  725.\n 6 h_lines         -0.062  54.3  281.  47.8  726.\n 7 high_lines      -0.069  54.3  281.  47.8  726.\n 8 slant_down      -0.069  54.3  281.  47.8  726.\n 9 slant_up        -0.069  54.3  281.  47.8  726.\n10 star            -0.063  54.3  281.  47.8  725.\n11 v_lines         -0.069  54.3  281.  47.8  726.\n12 wide_lines      -0.067  54.3  281.  47.8  726.\n13 x_shape         -0.066  54.3  281.  47.8  725.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou probably wouldn’t use a linear model for most of the panels of that plot because there isn’t a linear relationship between the feature (x-direction) and the response (y-direction). Plotting the data can also reveal problems or oddities in the data that will guide your further investigation."

    "section": "How the line is calculated",
    "text": "How the line is calculated\nA line is totally defined by its slope and intercept (intercept is where the line crosses the y-axis). The math of linear regression is just a way to calculate the slope and intercept of that line, and its intuition is also quite simple. It starts with the goal of minimizing the errors. There is an error for each dot, which is the difference between the line and the dot. To minimize the errors, we need to combine all those numbers into one (otherwise, you might have to worry about what effect a change in “A” has on “B”, etc.) A natural way to combine many numbers into one is to add them together. But there is a problem: errors can be negative (when the model fit is greater than the observed data.) If that seems complicated, just understand that both of these lines have residuals that sum to zero:\n\n\n\n\n\nA large negative error may be a good thing for “minimizing” error, but we don’t want that because the error is large. So the errors are squared before adding them together. This is the origin of terms you might have heard, like the sum of squared errors or the mean squared error.\n\nThe lm() function in R\nThe function to estimate a linear regression model in R is called lm(). We’ll get quite familiar with the function during this workshop. Now let’s use it to estimate the regression line in our penguin body size example.\n\npenguin_mass_model = lm(\n  body_mass_g ~ flipper_length_mm,\n  data=penguins)\nsummary(penguin_mass_model)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = body_mass_g ~ flipper_length_mm, data = penguins)\n\nResiduals:\n     Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max \n-1058.80  -259.27   -26.88   247.33  1288.69 \n\nCoefficients:\n                   Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(&gt;|t|)    \n(Intercept)       -5780.831    305.815  -18.90   &lt;2e-16 ***\nflipper_length_mm    49.686      1.518   32.72   &lt;2e-16 ***\n---\nSignif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n\nResidual standard error: 394.3 on 340 degrees of freedom\n  (2 observations deleted due to missingness)\nMultiple R-squared:  0.759, Adjusted R-squared:  0.7583 \nF-statistic:  1071 on 1 and 340 DF,  p-value: &lt; 2.2e-16\n\n\nThere is a bit of unique R code in the call to lm(): it uses R’s formula syntax. A formula in R has the response variable on the left of a tilde (~) and predictors on the right. You may see it in other contexts but its most common use is to specify the variables of a regression formula. Having used the lm() function to estimate the regression model, we then use the summary() function to inspect the model fit. Let’s dig into the summary() output.\nThe important parts of the summary() results are the Coefficients: and below. The first two parts of the summary() result (Call: and Residuals:) are usually not very interesting. At this point, you probably recognize that the Call: is repeating back the function call that created the model, and the Residuals: section tells you about the size of the residuals.\nStarting with Coefficients: we begin to learn about the model fit. You remember that the linear model fits a straight line to the data. And you might also know that you can describe a line by its slope and intercept, as in \\(y = ax + b\\). In that equation, \\(b\\) is the intercept and \\(a\\) is the slope, also known as the coefficient of \\(x\\). The coefficient of flipper_length_mm functions as the slope of our line, and it is listed in the Estimate column. As you might guess, the intercept of the estimated line is listed as under the Estimate column and the (Intercept) row.\nThe Std. Error column is an estimate of uncertainty in the coefficient estimates. The t value column is just the Estimate divided by the Std. Error, and it is used to calculate the Pr(&gt;|t|) column (better known as the coefficient p-value.)\nThe remaining information (Residual standard error, degrees of freedom, Multiple R-squared, Adjusted R-squared, F-statistic, and p-value) is beyond this introductory workshop. Just know that the p-value reported here is almost useless.\nIn contrast, the coefficient p-values, reported as Pr(&gt;|t|) in the Coefficients: table, are often the main focus of analysis. Making use of these p-values and interpreting the asterisks as indicators of statistical significance depends on proper use of the lm() function. In particular, you must decide which variables to use before fitting a model, and you can only try once - otherwise, the p-values will be biased by peeking at the result before doing the test."

    "section": "Assumptions of linear regression",
    "text": "Assumptions of linear regression\nThere are a few assumptions about your data that come with linear regression. Before you can accept the results, you must check these:\n\nLinearity: The actual relationship between the features and the response is linear. A trend in the fitted vs. residual plot is evidence that the linearity assumption may be wrong.\nCheck that the residuals have a normal distribution. You can check this via the Q-Q plot, which should have all the dots in an approximately straight line.\nConstant/equal residual variance: The residuals should have the same variability, also called the scale. Confirm this by the location-scale plot.\nThe residuals must be independent of each other. You can’t actually check this from the data, so you have to think carefully about how the value of one residual might depend upon others (for instance if they are measured at locations that touch, maybe there is something that affects both.) Data collection should be planned in order to have independent responses.\n\nLet’s check the assumptions on the penguin body size model:\n\nlayout(matrix(1:4, 2, 2))\nplot(penguin_mass_model)\n\n\n\n\nHere, there is a slight “U” shape in the Residual vs Fitted plot and in the Q-Q plot, which indicates that the relationship between flipper length and body mass is not quite linear. The points fall very close to the dashed diagonal on the Q-Q plot, which indicates that the residuals all seem to be from a nearly identical normal distribution. There is no clear pattern in the scale-location plot, so the residual variances are approximately equal. The deviations from ideal are pretty minor, and you could probably rely on this model to predict the mass of new penguins. But a more correct model is possible by looking at the species separately, as we’ll see in the next chapter."

    "text": "Multiple features\nOur example above has just a single feature to create a model for the response. It is more common to have multiple features, and there really is no limit to how many. However, if the number of features is greater than the number of observations, then we will have problems with the estimation methods.\nWhen there are multiple features, they may be correlated with each other. This is almost always true of observational data (which are features that are measured from the observed units). Typically, the only way to have perfectly uncorrelated data is by designing an experiment where the treatments are uncorrelated.\nCorrelated features will affect each others’ estimates, and the effect increases with the amount of correlation. That happens because when features are correlated, the model has similar fits if one coefficient increases and the other decreases, or vice versa.\nWe can reasonably assume that penguins with longer flippers and heavier bodies also have longer bills. That’s true, as seen in this figure:\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a result, including the bill length as a second feature in the model for body mass leads to a change in the estimated regression coefficient for flipper length and an increase in the uncertainty for that estimate:\n\ncorrelated_model = lm(\n  body_mass_g ~ flipper_length_mm + bill_length_mm,\n  data=penguins)\nsummary(correlated_model)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = body_mass_g ~ flipper_length_mm + bill_length_mm, \n    data = penguins)\n\nResiduals:\n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-1090.5  -285.7   -32.1   244.2  1287.5 \n\nCoefficients:\n                   Estimate Std.

A definitive answer is probably impossible, since the “best” model depends on the goal of the analysis, and model selection frequently ends in marginal and somewhat subjective decisions. In the simplest terms, the correct features for your model are the ones that are relevant to your analysis.\nIf your goal is to study is to understand the effect that some specific features have on the response, then it’s best to decide what those are before trying to estimate the model, and of course you have to keep in mind assumption (1) for linear models: “The actual relationship between the features and the response is linear.” This is a theory-driven approach to model selection, because you begin with an idea of the model you want to fit, and then tell the computer to estimate it.\nThere are data-driven ways of doing model selection, most of which can be summarized as: try a model and then change it to get a better fit. These approaches are dangerous because they tend to over-fit the training data, which usually makes the model less useful for future data. In order to mitigate that risk, a portion of the data has to be held out from the model fitting, to test the model with."

    "section": "Factors",
    "text": "Factors\nIn R, categorical variables are called factors. Deep down in the machinery of a regression model, factor effects are handled the same way as continuous features But to fully appreciate this, you have to understand that the factors are coded differently than continuous features. To begin, we should note that linear regression for factor variables is also a kind of scatterplot smoother. Let’s look at an example:\n\nPenguin body mass\nThe plot shows the mass of penguins measured at the Palmer Station LTER site in Antarctica, with the data coming from Allison Horst’s palmerpenguins package.\n\nggplot(penguins) + \n  aes(x=species, y=body_mass_g) +\n  geom_point() +\n  ggtitle(\"Body mass of penguins by species\") +\n  ylab(\"Mass (g)\")\n\nWarning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values (`geom_point()`).\n\n\n\n\n\nLook carefully at the x-axis and you’ll see that the coordinates are species names, not numbers. A line drawn to fit the points would imply that there is a specific order to the species and a specific spacing between them, and that there are some intermediate values where the mass would be somewhere between the known species. But none of those are true.\n\nggplot(penguins) +\n  aes(x=species, y=body_mass_g) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_abline(intercept=1800, slope=1200, color=\"blue\") +\n  ggtitle(\"Body mass of penguins by species with linear fit\") +\n  ylab(\"Mass (g)\")\n\nClearly, we need to treat the species as categories, rather than as coordinates along a continuum. Looking at the summary of a regression model gives a clue as to how that works.\n\npenguin_lm = lm(body_mass_g ~ species, data=penguins)\ntidy(penguin_lm) |&gt; kable(digits=2)\n\n\n\n\nterm\nestimate\nstd.error\nstatistic\np.value\n\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\n3700.66\n37.62\n98.37\n0.00\n\n\nspeciesChinstrap\n32.43\n67.51\n0.48\n0.63\n\n\nspeciesGentoo\n1375.35\n56.15\n24.50\n0.00\n\n\n\n\n\nNow let’s see the mean masses of the three species.\n\ncat(\"Mean mass by species:\\n\")\n\nMean mass by species:\n\npenguin_means = with(penguins_small, split(body_mass_g, species)) |&gt;\n  sapply(mean, na.rm=TRUE) |&gt;\n  round(2)\nprint(penguin_means)\n\n   Adelie Chinstrap    Gentoo \n     3580      3660      5150 \n\n\nNotice that the fitted value of the (Intercept) is identical to the average mass of an Adelie penguin, and that there are two rows of species effects, instead of the one row that we saw for the continuous effects so far. The values of the Estimate column in those rows are the estimated effects for Chinstrap and Gentoo penguins - and they are equal to the difference between the average mass of those penguins and Adelie penguins.\n\n\nDesign matrix\nThe reason that the results look like this can be made more clear if you look at the way R converts the categories to numbers. The model.matrix() is the function that R uses internally to prepare data for an lm(), but we can call it ourselves. Remember that linear regression works by multiplying each term by a coefficient, adding adding the results together. Here, we have three terms for the three species. Adelie has been automatically selected as the reference level because it appears first in the data.\n\ntail(model.matrix(penguin_lm))\n\n    (Intercept) speciesChinstrap speciesGentoo\n339           1                1             0\n340           1                1             0\n341           1                1             0\n342           1                1             0\n343           1                1             0\n344           1                1             0\n\n\nHere, we have three terms: (Intercept), speciesChinstrap, and speciesGentoo. So to calculate the mass that is estimated for row 12, we will add 1 * (Intercept) + 1 * speciesGentoo. Since the effect (Intercept) is the average mass of the Adelie penguins, the effect speciesGentoo must be the difference between the mean mass of Gentoo penguins and the mean mass of Adelie penguins. Why no term for speciesAdelie? It’s because the fit would then depend on how mass was apportioned between the penguin species and the intercept. You could increase the intercept by 10 grams and reduce all three species estimates by 10 grams and end up with the same model fit, despite different effects. The computer has no way of deciding between those options, because it just optimizing the model fit.\nYou don’t have to set one factor level to be the reference for estimation, but that goes beyond the scope of this introductory workshop. You may need to change which level is the reference, and that is within our scope. R has a function relevel(), which takes the argument ref=, which specifies the reference level of a factor. Here is how it would work to set Gentoo as the reference level:\n\npenguins$species = relevel(penguins$species, ref=\"Gentoo\")\nreleveled_penguin_model = lm(body_mass_g ~ species, data=penguins)\nsummary(releveled_penguin_model)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = body_mass_g ~ species, data = penguins)\n\nResiduals:\n     Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max \n-1126.02  -333.09   -33.09   316.91  1223.98 \n\nCoefficients:\n                 Estimate Std.

However we set the factor levels, the model predictions remain unchanged, which helps emphasize that the factor coding affects which interpretation(s) are emphasized in the summary but does not change the model.\n\n# compare predictions between the models with different contrasts:\npred_df = data.frame(species=c(\"Adelie\", \"Chinstrap\", \"Gentoo\"))\npredict(penguin_lm, pred_df)\n\n       1        2        3 \n3700.662 3733.088 5076.016 \n\npredict(releveled_penguin_model, pred_df)\n\n       1        2        3 \n3700.662 3733.088 5076.016"

    "text": "Generalized linear regression\nWe won’t put much emphasis on generalized linear models (GLMs) in this workshop, but they are important and so you might want to know about them. GLMs are used when the response variable has some distribution other than normal - logistic regression (binary response) is by far the most commonly used GLM and Poisson regression (count response) is fairly common, too. In any case, the differences between an ordinary linear model and a generalized linear model are fairly minor.\n\nResponse distribution is different. As a result:\n\nResponse variance is no longer assumed equal (when variance depends on mean).\nThe linear model predicts a transformed version of the mean, rather than predicting the mean itself (the mean is transformed by what’s called a “Link Function”).\nThus, diagnostics have to change.\n\n\n\nLogistic Regression - UC Berkeley Admissions\nThe UCBAdmissions dataset is built into R and provides a tabulation of how many men and women applied and were admitted to six departments at UC Berkeley in 1973. Suppose we want to estimate whether male or female applicants were more likely than the other to be admitted. Since each admission decision is binary, we will use a generalized linear model with binomial response to estimate the effect of gender on admission probability. The data are built-in as an array so we need to convert them to a data frame before getting started.\n\nlibrary(tidyr)\nucb = as.data.frame(UCBAdmissions) |&gt;\n  pivot_wider(names_from = Admit, values_from = Freq)\n\nucb\n\n# A tibble: 12 × 4\n   Gender Dept  Admitted Rejected\n   &lt;fct&gt;  &lt;fct&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 Male   A          512      313\n 2 Female A           89       19\n 3 Male   B          353      207\n 4 Female B           17        8\n 5 Male   C          120      205\n 6 Female C          202      391\n 7 Male   D          138      279\n 8 Female D          131      244\n 9 Male   E           53      138\n10 Female E           94      299\n11 Male   F           22      351\n12 Female F           24      317\n\n\nNow fit the binomial regression model for admission probability. By default, R uses logistic regression for a binomial response. Because the observations are aggregated by gender and department, we have to pair the Admitted and Rejected columns as the response. If each row represented a single observation and the Admitted column were coded as 0/1 or TRUE/FALSE, we could use it alone as the response.\n\n# estimate a logistic regression model.\nucb_model = glm(cbind(Admitted, Rejected) ~ Dept + Gender, data=ucb, family='binomial')\n\n# plot the diagnostics\nlayout(matrix(1:4, 2, 2))\nplot(ucb_model)\n\n\n\n# show the model summary\nsummary(ucb_model)\n\n\nCall:\nglm(formula = cbind(Admitted, Rejected) ~ Dept + Gender, family = \"binomial\", \n    data = ucb)\n\nCoefficients:\n             Estimate Std.

These look only OK. According to the model summary, there are significant differences in admission rates by departments and not by gender.\nFor a logistic regression model, the estimated coefficients are reported as log odds ratios. A log odds ratio greater than zero corresponds to probability greater than 50%, and vice versa. Both Dept and Gender are categorical, so you can figure the estimated log odds ratio for a particular combination by adding the relevant rows from the summary table. The default level of this combination is Male and DeptA.\n\n&lt;!— ## Poisson Regression - Effectiveness of Bug Sprays\nHere is an example of a Poisson regression model.\n\nmodel_spray = glm(count ~ spray, data=InsectSprays, family='poisson')\nsummary(model_spray)\n\n\nCall:\nglm(formula = count ~ spray, family = \"poisson\", data = InsectSprays)\n\nCoefficients:\n            Estimate Std.

In that case, the yields from the same plot are more alike than from other plots, even on the same field. But they are generally more alike within the same field than plots from different fields.

Here’s an example using the sleep study data: the difference is that now the random effect of subject is not only that each subject was has somewhat quicker or slower reflexes that change by the same amount each day. Instead, each subject has somewhat quicker or slower reflexes that change by a personally unique amount each day (meanwhile, we have still estimated the fixed effect of days - which is the amount that an average person’s reaction time slowed down with each day of sleep deprivation.\n\nrandom_slope_model = lmer(Reaction ~ Days + (1 + Days|Subject), data=sleepstudy)\n\nLooking at the plot of random effects, we see that the people with the quickest reactions also were less affected by sleep deprivation (lowest lines have the flattest slopes), and the people with the slowest reactions also were most affected by sleep deprivation (highest lines have the steepest slopes.)\n\n# Predict the fitted values from the mixed-effects model\nsleepstudy$random_slope_fitted &lt;- predict(random_slope_model)\n\n# Create a scatterplot of fitted reaction times against Days\nggplot(sleepstudy) +\n  aes(x = Days, y = random_slope_fitted, color = Subject) +\n   # geom_point() +\n   geom_line() +\n   labs(title = \"Fitted Reaction Time vs. Days by Subject\",\n        x = \"Days\",\n        y = \"Fitted Reaction Time (ms)\") +\n  geom_point(data=sleepstudy, mapping=aes(x=Days, y=Reaction, color=Subject))\n\n\n\n\nThis is also seen in the model summary, where there is a (slightly) positive correlation between the random slope and random intercept.\n\nsummary(random_slope_model)\n\nLinear mixed model fit by REML ['lmerMod']\nFormula: Reaction ~ Days + (1 + Days | Subject)\n   Data: sleepstudy\n\nREML criterion at convergence: 1743.6\n\nScaled residuals: \n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-3.9536 -0.4634  0.0231  0.4634  5.1793 \n\nRandom effects:\n Groups   Name        Variance Std.Dev.

First, plot the data:\n\n# plot the orange tree data\nggplot(Orange) +\n  aes(x=age, y=circumference, color=Tree) +\n  geom_point()\n\n\n\n\nThis looks like (fairly) linear growth with the same intercept (all the trees appear to have circumference zero at day zero) but slightly different growth rates. So let’s use a random slope model.\n\nmodel_orange = lmer(circumference ~ (age - 1 | Tree), data=Orange)\nsummary(model_orange)\n\nLinear mixed model fit by REML ['lmerMod']\nFormula: circumference ~ (age - 1 | Tree)\n   Data: Orange\n\nREML criterion at convergence: 289.3\n\nScaled residuals: \n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-1.9824 -0.5130 -0.0082  0.7997  1.6243 \n\nRandom effects:\n Groups   Name Variance  Std.Dev.\n Tree     age    0.01172  0.1082 \n Residual      100.93833 10.0468 \nNumber of obs: 35, groups:  Tree, 5\n\nFixed effects:\n            Estimate Std.
