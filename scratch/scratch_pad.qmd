```{r simplest-linear-model}
#| echo: false
#| include: false

# import data and create linear model
data(cars)
xx = seq(5, 25, length.out=5)
m_cars = lm(dist~speed, data=cars)
```

```{r cars-plot}
plot(cars, xlab="Speed (mph)", ylab="Distance to stop (ft)", bty='n')
abline(-17.6, 3.9)
```

## Residuals
We have a special term for the difference between the fitted line and the true dots. We call the differences residuals, and there is one per dot. The difference is calculated as the vertical distance, as shown here:

```{r residual-example}
#| echo: false
i = 26
plot(cars, xlab="Speed (mph)", ylab="Distance to stop (ft)", bty='n')
lines(xx, predict(m_cars, newdata=data.frame(speed=xx)))
for (i in c(4, 22, 25, 45)) {
  with(cars,
       lines(
          rep(cars$speed[[i]], 2),
          c(dist[[i]], predict(m_cars, newdata=data.frame(speed=cars$speed[[i]]))),
          lty=3,
          col='red',
          lwd=2
       )
  )
}
```
